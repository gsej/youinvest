Have the process transactions script output a list of objects like this:

[
{
	date: 2011-01-01,
	holdings: [
// holdings here....
	]
}
]

... however.... there will be multiple transacftions for some dates. They need to be grouped to produce a single output




and add some tests....


create webui to display portfolio by date...
